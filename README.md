## 📖 About
**Flux Recorder** is an open-source alternative to OEM system recorders (like Samsung's or Pixel's). It prioritizes **performance and integration** over gimmicks. 

Built entirely in **Native Kotlin** using **Jetpack Compose**, it utilizes the low-level `MediaCodec` API to ensure zero-lag recording during high-fidelity gaming. The UI features a distinct "Electric Flux" dark theme optimized for AMOLED screens.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎮 Native Integration & UX
* **Quick Settings Tile:** Launch the recorder immediately from your notification shade (`TileService`). No need to open the app drawer.
* **Floating Control Bubble:** A non-intrusive, transparent overlay (`WindowManager`) that floats over games to Pause, Stop, or Draw.
* **Shake-to-Stop:** Uses the accelerometer to end recording instantly without pulling down the status bar.
* **Public Storage:** Recordings are saved directly to `Movies/FluxRecorder` for easy access by other apps (Gallery, Google Photos, etc.).

### ⚡ "Flux" Performance Engine
* **Zero-Lag Encoding:** Hardware-accelerated H.264/AVC encoding.
* **Smart Bitrate (VBR):** Automatically calculates optimal bitrate based on screen resolution and motion, balancing quality and file size.
* **Smart Orientation:** Detects physical device rotation to record in true Portrait or Landscape mode.
* **High Fidelity:** Supports **1080p, 2K, and 4K** at **60/90 FPS** (device dependent).
* **Freeze Prevention:** Advanced frame handling ensures video doesn't freeze even during heavy load or when scrolling through dynamic content.

### 🎨 Creative & Audio
* **Pro Audio Mixing:** Record **Internal Audio** (Android 10+) and **Microphone** simultaneously. The "Both" mode intelligently mixes system sounds with your voice commentary.
* **Facecam (PiP):** Resizable, floating circle overlay using `CameraX`.
* **Live Annotations:** "Draw on Screen" mode to highlight areas during tutorials.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Android Studio (Iguana/Koala or newer recommended)
* JDK 17
* Physical Android Device (Emulators cannot record screen effectively).

### Installation
1.  Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Icradle-Innovations-Ltd/FluxRecorder.git
    ```
2.  Open in Android Studio.
3.  Sync Gradle.
4.  Run on device.

### ⚠️ Android 14 Compatibility Note
Google introduced strict rules for `MediaProjection` in Android 14 (API 34).
1.  **Per-Session Consent:** The system permission dialog will appear **every time** you start a recording. This is mandatory OS behavior and cannot be bypassed.
2.  **Foreground Service:** The app must declare `foregroundServiceType="mediaProjection"` in the Manifest.
